                <p>My name is Melvin. I grew up in India and have lived in San Mateo for two years.</p>
                <p>Currently, I work as a Solution Engineer at a Biotech Software company.</p>
                <p>I'm taking this class to improve my web development skills as I prepare for a Master's program and potentially transition my career to Software Engineering.</p>
                <p>I recently remembered the time I went trekking in the Indian Himalayas with my friends; I thought that it would be a great picture to share with you all.</p>
                <p>This experience taught me how maintaining a quick, consistent cadence prevents you from tiring out while keeping you ahead.</p>
                <p>I realized that my mindset could either limit or enhance my abilities in different situations; the critical factor was always my attitude - and attenuating that made all the difference.</p>
